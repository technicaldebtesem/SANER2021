    <h2> The alluvial diagram below represents the relationships between the top 10 technical debt (TD) effects and their TD payment-related practices and reasons for TD non-payment. <br> <br>
		Some instructions: <br>
		1. A node represents an effect, a practice, or a reason for TD non-payment. <br>
		2. A link represents the relationship between an effect and a practice or an effect and a reason. <br>
		3. Each link has a magnitude. The greater this magnitude, the wider the link. To view the magnitude of a link, place your mouse over it. <br> <br></h2>
